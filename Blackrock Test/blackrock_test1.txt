Programming challenge description:
The goal of this question is to print out which portfolios have open positions.

A portfolio is represented by a name, and a collection of positions. Each position has a name, a start date, and an end date.

A position is considered to be open on a given date if its starting date is before or on the given date and its end date is either not specified or on a later date than the given date.

Input:
Your program should read lines of text from standard input (this is already part of the initial template). The first line will specify a date (in YYYY-MM-DD format). The rest of the lines will specify portfolios in the following format:

PortfolioName|PositionName:startDate:endDate,PositionName:startDate:endDate

If any dates are missing or in the wrong format, they can be considered null.

For example, this will be a valid input:

2020-01-01
XXKCN|BRTHFKS01:2019-01-04:2019-05-03,CHDKWYNK:2020-01-04:2022-12-24
XXKSN|BRTHFKS04:2019-11-04:,PSNKWYNK:2020-06-01:2022-12-24 
XXPSN|BRTHFKS02:2023-01-04:2019-05-03,SHDNWYNK:2024-01-01:2022-12-24,SHDNWPSH:2027-01-01:2030-12-24
Output:
If a portfolio contains at least an open position, print the portfolio name on a single line to standard output.

The portfolio names should be printed on separate lines in the order in which they first appear in the input

For example, this will be a valid output (there should be no extra new lines or spaces either before or after the portfolio list):

XXKCE
XXKSP
XXKSQ
If there are no open positions output "NONE", for example

NONE
